# AIShakespeare

I created this repository to train a transformer model using Shakespeare's 
text. I am inspired by Andrej Karpathy's YouTube [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&pp=ygUYQW5kcmVqIGthcnBhdGh5IG5hbm8gZ3B0).

Trained a custom WordPiece tokenizer from scratch using Hugging Face's 
transformers library.

Aim is that AIShakespeare will predict the next word based on the 
previous word(s). I intend to tryout multiple transformer model 
architectures.
